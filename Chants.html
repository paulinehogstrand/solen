      <p><b>Chants</b> is the third album by Swedish-born, Copenhagen-based violist and composer Pauline Hogstrand. Written in the final months of her twin pregnancy and performed by Crush String Collective with percussionists Anders Vestergaard and Victor Dybbroe, the five-movement suite unfolds as a meditation on openness, co-creation, and presence.
Following her acclaimed electroacoustic releases The Enterer (2020) and Áhkká (2023), Hogstrand here returns to the instrumental ensemble, weaving strings, percussion, and synthesizer into music that balances refinement and rawness, stillness and transformation—a quiet invocation for the heart to open.</p>
